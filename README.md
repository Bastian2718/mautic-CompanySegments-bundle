# Plugin: Company Segments by Leuchtfeuer



## Overview

This plugin brings company-based Segments to Mautic.

It is part of the "ABM" suite of plugins that extends Mautic capabilities for working with Companies.

## Requirements
- Mautic 5.x (minimum 5.1)
- PHP 8.1 or higher

## Installation
### Composer
This plugin can be installed through composer.

### Manual install
Alternatively, it can be installed manually, following the usual steps:

* Download the plugin
* Unzip to the Mautic `plugins` directory
* Rename folder to `LeuchtfeuerCompanySegmentsBundle` 

-
* In the Mautic backend, go to the `Plugins` page as an administrator
* Click on the `Install/Upgrade Plugins` button to install the Plugin.

OR

* If you have shell access, execute `php bin\console cache:clear` and `php bin\console mautic:plugins:reload` to install the plugins.

## Plugin Activation and Configuration
1. Go to `Plugins` page
2. Click on the `Company Segments` plugin
3. ENABLE the plugin

## Usage
The plugin brings a new menu item `Companies -> Company Segments`. Here you can create and manage your Company Segments, and see the number of Companies are in each Segment. When you click on that number, you go to a pre-filtered Company list view.

You can also filter manually for Company Segments in the Company list view. Just enter `segment:<company segment alias name>` in the filter.

In the Company single view, you will now find a green bubble for each of the company's tag, on the right hand side. Click the bubble to remove the tag from the company with one click.

In the Company edit view, you can add or remove tags as desired.

In Campaigns, you now have a new Actions called:
* "Modify Company Tags"
* "Modify Company Segments".

In Campaigns, you now have a new Condition called "Company Segments"

In Reports, you now have a new data source "Company Tags" that allows you to filter on Company Tags.

To update the Company Segments based on their filter, there is a console command as cron job: `php bin/console leuchtfeuer:abm:segments-update`. It works just like with lead segments.


## Troubleshooting
Make sure you have not only installed but also enabled the Plugin.

If things are still funny, please try

`php bin/console cache:clear`

and 

`php bin/console mautic:assets:generate`

## Known Issues
* MAJOR: The manual mofication of Company Segment membership is prctically  broken, because it is overwritten by the console command.
* In the Company Segements view, the number of Companies are in each Segment is currently not calculated correctly.
* In the Company Segements view, the "select all" checkbox does not work properly.
* An exception occurs when cancelling the creation of a new Segment

## Future Ideas
* Manual modification of Segments from Company detail view
* Manual modification of Segments from Company list view without bulk action
* Show Company Segments in Company Detail View as "Bubbles"
